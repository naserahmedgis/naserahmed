								<p> Hi, my name is Naser Ahmed and welcome to my website. I am a second-year master's student in Geographic Information Science (GIS) at the Department of Geography and Environment, Western University, awarded with the Western Graduate Research Scholarship. Title of my thesis: Transportation and Land Use Planning for Healthy Cities. I am also working as a GIS associate in the Human Environments Analysis Laboratory (HEAL) at Western, where I am contributing to the ParkSeek project. Additionally, I serve as a teaching assistant at Western University, where I teach GIS and Remote Sensing. </p>
								<p> Recently, I worked as a lead research assistant in the Parks Canada General Class Grants and Contributions Program, where I successfully completed a project focused on conducting a social equity analysis of public transit-based accessibility to candidate National Urban Parks (NUPs) in 15 cities across Canada. I am primarily interested in transportation planning and is dedicated to promoting sustainable and healthy public transit systems. Check out my <a href="#project">awesome work</a>.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Research interest</h2>
								<p> My research interests lie in the field of transportation geography, urban planning, public health, GIS, and Remote Sensing. I am committed to exploring ways to create sustainable and resilient mobility from an equity perspective. My research questions focus on three key areas: 1) sustainability, 2) accessibility, and 3) social equity.</p>
								<p>Empirical: Accessibility, mobility, sustainable transportation and social equity, and healthy cities.</p>
								<p>Methodological: Geographic information science, Remote Sensing, Spatial Statistics.</p>
								<p>Skills and software: GIS, spatial data science, transportation planning, R, Python, HTML, ArcGIS, QGIS, satellite image application.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Cost of Climate Change</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/temperature_new_analysis.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cost_new_analysis.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Public transit offers urban populations physical accessibility to resources and opportunities.  However, at the same time, transit trips often expose users to extreme environmental conditions, such as extreme heat and cold since transit journeys usually include out-of-vehicle trip segments including walking and waiting.  Such exposure can be considered as environmental health costs because exposure to weather extremes can lead to adverse health outcomes.  Even worse, climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events.  In this context, how can we make public transit accessibility measures ready for climate change?  This project answers the question by developing a general cost function approach combining travel time and environmental health costs into an integrated measure of dual accessibility: a measure of the travel costs of accessing a fixed number of destinations. We synthesize transport science, environmental health, remote sensing, and urban climatology to
									empower the proposed framework. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method,
									we carry out an example study that incorporates transit passengers' extreme cold
									exposure into accessibility measures in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. 
									Further, we perform a social equity analysis to investigate whether the increase in total
									integrated costs (i.e., decrease in accessibility) due to the inclusion of environmental
									health costs disproportionately affects socially disadvantaged population groups.  The
									proposed method enables a more realistic and practical measurement of public transit
									accessibility under climate change; thereby, improving the readiness and resilience of
									our society and transport systems for future challenges.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Transit to National Urban Parks</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Map_Saskatoon.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In 2021, the Government of Canada committed to establishing up to 15 national urban parks (NUPs) in every province and territory by 2025 to better ensure that Canadians have access to greenspace and, by extension, support public health and well-being.  Given that geographic accessibility to candidate NUPs might be disproportionally distributed within cities, it is important to assess how various aspects of social equity, including transit-based accessibility, can be effectively linked to NUP planning.  To address this gap, we evaluate the geographic accessibility of the 15 candidate NUPs based on public transit through a transportation and environmental justice lens.  Specifically, we perform a social equity analysis to investigate whether there are statistically significant differences in transit-based accessibility to NUPs between minority- versus non-minority population-dominant neighbourhoods.</p>

								<p>During my graduate studies at Western, I had the opportunity to work as a GIS associate on an exciting project called <a href="https://parkseek.ca/project-overview/">ParkSeek</a>. The overarching goal of the ParkSeek project is to build a platform for Canadian-specific research and practice related to the interconnections between population health and parks and recreational facilities.  </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2SFCA.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Average_travel_time2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This research aims to explore the inequalities and vulnerabilities in geographic
									accessibility to emergency cyclone shelters in Bangladesh, a country in the Global
									South that is prone to natural disasters.  We first quantify walking time to the nearest
									cyclone shelters as a basic measure of accessibility.  Additionally, we compute a more
									practical measure of accessibility by considering crowding effects in shelters due to the
									interactions between supply (e.g., shelter capacity) and demand (e.g., population
									levels) using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method.  We examine
									accessibility inequalities through the Gini index.  Furthermore, we perform a
									vulnerability analysis with an equity lens to examine whether marginalized populations
									are disproportionately located in vulnerable areas with insufficient accessibility.  The
									results indicate substantial inequalities in 2SFCA-based cyclone shelter accessibility
									across different regions.  The vulnerability analysis results reveal that seniors, females,
									individuals with physical disabilities, and religious minorities are disproportionately
									located in areas requiring more than the government guideline of 20 minutes walking
									time to the nearest shelters.  This study is one of the first attempts to understand the
									inequalities and vulnerabilities in geographic accessibility to emergency cyclone
									shelters in an under-examined low- and middle-income country (LMIC) in the Global
									South like Bangladesh.  By shedding light on the inequalities and vulnerabilities faced
									in accessing these critical facilities, our research contributes to the broader
									understanding of human mobility and accessibility in response to the increasing
									intensity and frequency of unexpected disruption events in the context of climate
									change.</p>

								<h2 class="major">urban green space deserts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/UGS_deserts.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A lingering question in the research on urban green space (UGS) availability in the Global South is which walking
									distance threshold should be used due to the absence of consensus on that in the literature and planning
									guidelines. This paper answers that question by developing an analytical framework for identifying UGS deserts -
									areas without adequate UGS availability level - considering various walking distance thresholds. We first
									demonstrate how geographic distributions of UGS deserts can change depending on different walking distance
									thresholds (e.g., 100, 300, 500 m) of choice. Unreliable and inaccurate detection of UGS deserts can hinder
									evidence-based land use planning for promoting healthy cities and result in erroneous social equity evaluation.
									To overcome this limitation, we introduce and examine robust UGS oases and deserts: geographic areas with and
									without the per capita green space (PCG) level recommended by a local government regardless of different
									walking distance thresholds used, respectively. With the identified robust UGS deserts and oases, we perform a
									social equity analysis to investigate inequality and whether there are systematic disadvantages for socioeconomically vulnerable populations to access UGS in Dhaka, a rapidly developing capital city in Bangladesh. The
									robust UGS deserts approach enables more reliable and informed decision-making to enhance UGS availability
									and its social equity, thereby facilitating an optimal development of urban policy for healthy cities. More
									practically, our robust UGS deserts method can be an effective alternative to detect UGS deserts when guidelines
									for walking distance thresholds are missing which is often the case in low- and middle-income countries. </p>
